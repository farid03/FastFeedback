## Frontend Setup

1. Install nvm (Node Version Manager)
1. In the root of the repo (NOT! in /frontend) use `nvm use`
1. In the root of the repo use `npm install`
1. In /frontend use `npm install`


Now you are ready!


To run frontend in development mode from /frontend use `npm start`. This will
instantiate a fast-reload webpack server that will bundle and serve frontend,
automatically reloading on every change in the codebase.


To build production frontend from /frontend use `npm build`. This will automatically
place every build artefact into /frontend/build.
